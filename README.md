#The-Domain-Name-Generator

Java Script Exercise The Domain Name Generator Finding a domain name is hard, why not automate it? :)

Instructions Create a script that generate all the possible domain name combinations from a list of pronouns, adjectives and nouns, for example:

var pronoun = ['the','our']; var adj = ['great', 'big' ]; var noun = ['jogger','racoon']; Should generate something like:

thegreatjogger.com thegreatracoon.com ourgreatjogger.com ourgreatracoon.com thebigjogger.com thebigracoon.com ourbigjogger.com ourbigracoon.com Hint: you'll need to use nested for loops in order to mix the different values together.

Your tools: For loop, string concatenation.

A bit of history about the project (read only if you care) Before the domain market was centralized and converted into a mafia controlled by Godaddy, Enom and some others. Earsth citizends like you and me were able to buy a .com domain realtively easy.

In fact, this project was originally built in 2002 by one of 4Geeks teachers while he was trying to find domain names to buy for several projects.
